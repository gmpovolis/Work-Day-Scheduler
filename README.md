# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

This application is a simple work day scheduler that allows the user to visually see hour blocks for a 9-5 time schedule. In a jumbotron there is the name of the application, along with a brief description and the current day, month, and day of the month.

## Usage

There are three fields in each row. A time block, and text block and a save block.

The time block displays which hour in the schedule alond with an AM or PM value.

The text blocks are color coded to seperate between past(gray), present(red), and future(green). The user can also type text into those blocks to add tasks or whatever the user wishes.

The save block is a button that when clicked will save the text in the text block to the local storage. 

When the schedule is build by the for loop it will add the local storage values to the value of the corresponding input text row.
